# 🔹 dynamic Routing in Next.js

### To create this route:
```
http://localhost:3000/products/1
```
## Folder structure:
```
app/
  products/
    [id]/
      page.tsx
```
Example: `page.tsx`
```.tsx
export default async function ProductDetails({ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
    // Resolve the promise
    const obj = await params
    const productId = obj.id

    return <>
        <h1>Product - {pId} loaded</h1>
    </>
}
```
- Just make an folder within `[]`
- That folder will works as dynamic route
  - URL example:
    - http://localhost:3000/products/1
    - http://localhost:3000/products/iphone
-  `http://localhost:3000/products/[id]`
-  [id] can be any dynamic value.
- That value will automaticaly receives inside the `page.tsx` inside [id] folder.
## Key points : 
- The function should accept a params argument and destructure it.
- The params type is a Promise that resolves to a key-value pair.
- You can use the dynamic value anywhere in your component via {pId}.

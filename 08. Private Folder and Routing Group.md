# Private Folder : 
- In nextjs every folder is by default acts as route or segment.
- So if we want to make any folder that will not be a part of out route and make a private folder: we can user `_`(undeerscore) as prefix.
- example : `_lib`
```
app/
  _lib/
    page.tsx
```
- If we search for :  `localhost:3000/_lib` -> not found as result

# Routing Group:
- we can make related route as a group
- Suppose , login,register,forget-password can be grouped as auth

```
app/
  auth/
    login/
      page.tsx
    register/
      page.tsx
    forget-passoword/
      page.tsx
```
- There not grouped yet
- Still : `auth/login`  :  `auth/register` :  `auth/forget-password`
- TO make them group : use `()`
- (auth)
```
app/
  (auth)/
    login/
      page.tsx
    register/
      page.tsx
    forget-passoword/
      page.tsx
```
- Now routes become : `localhost:3000/login`
- auth folder itself not part of route.
- It acts like grouped the all 3 route.

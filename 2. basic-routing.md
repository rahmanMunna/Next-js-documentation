# 🔹 Routing in Next.js (App Router)
- In nextjs , under app folder, every folder name works a route.
- Everything inside the app/ directory follows a file-based routing system.
  - Each folder = route
  - Each page.tsx = UI for that route
## ✅ Basic Routing:
### To create this route:
```
http://localhost:3000/products
```
## Folder structure:
```
app/
  products/
    page.tsx
```
- So, to make a route we need 2 things.
    - Make a folder
    - Make a `page.tsx` file inside that folder.
    - Foder works as route and `page.tsx` works as UI.
 
Example: `page.tsx`
```
export default function About(){
    return <h1>This is products page</h1>
}
```
- Make and export an function
- This function will return a single component as like react
- We can use any dynamic value using `{}`
- Like : `<h1>This is products {dynamic value} page</h1>`
